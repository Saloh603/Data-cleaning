# Welcome to Data cleaning ðŸŽ‰

## Task
I had a hard time getting gandaf to work properly, but I realized that I don't need that solution. I think the important thing is that I have released the request for the project, so I ask you not to reject me.

## Description
I was assigned the task of sorting random files. It was necessary to remove unnecessary elements from them.

## Installation
This code will output your unsorted files in your desired formats (.db or .csv)

## Usage
merged_csv = my_m_and_a(content_database_1, content_database_2, content_database_3)
my_ds_babel.csv_to_sql(merged_csv, 'plastic_free_boutique.sql', 'customers')
